           <h4> D K Arvind <br> Professor at School of Informatics <br> University of Edinburgh, UK </h4>
 <br>
        He has pioneered the design of processor architectures as asynchronous networks and the hardware-software co-design of resource-constrained programmable architectures for wireless applications. He is the Director of the Centre for Speckled Computing and has been the Principal Investigator (PI) on projects funded by UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Scottish Funding Council (SFC), EU Framework 7, Scottish Enterprise, US Office of Naval Research, US Air Force Research Laboratory, and by leading technology companies including ARM, Hitachi, Otto Bock Gmbh, Panasonic, RedKite Animations, Sharp, Sun Research Labs, SAS, Selex Galileo and Xilinx. He was the PI and founding Director of the £5.3M EPSRC- and SFC-funded Research Consortium in Speckled Computing (2003-10): an interdisciplinary consortium of computer scientists, electrochemists, physicists and electronic engineers drawn from five UK universities. His research interests include the design, analysis and integration of miniature networked embedded systems which combine sensing, processing and wireless networking capabilities targeted at applications in healthcare, digital media and environmental monitoring.
